# 100 Day LeetCode Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Day LeetCode Challenge repository! This project documents my journey as I tackle one LeetCode question each day for 100 days. The goal is to improve my coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with algorithms and data structures.

## Introduction

LeetCode is a popular platform for coding interviews and practice. This challenge is a personal commitment to consistently practice coding problems, refine my skills, and share my solutions with others. Each day, I'll solve one problem and document my thought process, approach, and solution.

## How to Use This Repository

- Clone this repository to your local machine using:

- Each day's solution will be in a separate folder named `Day X`, where `X` is the day number (1 to 100).
- Each folder contains:
  - A description of the problem.
  - My approach and thought process.
  - The solution code.
  - Test cases (if applicable).
